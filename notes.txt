* running uplink on remote requires paying 2x bandwidth
* local requires roughly double horsepower
* next few days or weeks "libuplink" (replaces libstorj), abstracts logic behind minio


* segments are uploade sequentially
	* small time where the upload may appear stalled
	* will be improved in the future
	* > can always create issues to help identify issues


* stefanb can spin up some storage nodes to talk to satellites
	* will be unsigned
	* keep in mind that we can move to signed (this would involve paying operators)
